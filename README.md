## Introduction
  
I'm 27 years old and i'm a web developer.

I am a person with initiative and motivation, and i love learning and trying new stuff, whether it is [Atole agrio][2] or [Firebase][7]. 

While working on a project i act by the words my dad once said to me "*Don't do something a computer could*", meaning not to waste ourselves working in repetitive or boring tasks but instead to create pieces of software to help us and to make our lives easier.

A colleague once said to me "You solve problems no one had seen"

For me software engineering 
huella prueba de esta era



## Education

Med School (unfinished) at Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México (2005 - 2011). 


## Experience

From 2011 to 2015 I worked as Lead Developer for Paradigma Cero, a Digital Marketing Agency.

 at first i was responsible for building and


i challenged the way of developing web sites and apps which included:

As sole developer:

- Moved the email-based workflow to a project-based workflow using Open Atrium to centralize all the project's information and resources.
- Before my arrival no CMS was being take advantage of. my first project in the agency was a migration from a file-based blog to Joomla.
- I developed a series of web apps which allowed our customers to create html documents for emailing with no need of programming knowledge (WYSIWYG like).


I'd like to address that these are things i was not asked to do.




As Lead Developer:

- I mentored several jr developers in using  **[Sublime text][5]** [the right way][4]
- Implemented VCS company-wide using Git and Bitbucket.
- j

I'm always searching for new ways do things better, that's why in the last years (and months)i've learned and implemented in my projects:  **[Sublime text][5]** [the right way][4], GIT, **[Jekyll][6]**, and [Dandelion][3] among many other things.




From 2005 to 2007 I worked part time and on project-basis for Political Party "Convergencia" (now "Movimiento Ciudadano") Chapter "Estado de México".
