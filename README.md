## Introduction
  
I'm 27 years old and i'm a web developer. I like to think of myself as a motivated and curious person. I love learning and trying new stuff, whether it is [Atole agrio][2] or [Dandelions][3]. 

While working on a project i act by the words my dad once said to me "Don't do work the computer can do", meaning not waste ourselves working in repetitive tasks but instead to design and develop pieces of software to help us and to make our lifes easier. 

I'm always searching for new ways to improve my workflow that's why in my previous job introduced several workflow improvements: introducing **[Sublime text][5]** [the right way][4], implementing GIT and **[Jekyll][6]** among many other things.
