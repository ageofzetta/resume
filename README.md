## Introduction
  
I'm 27 years old and i'm a web developer.

I am a person with initiative and motivation, and I love learning and trying new stuff, whether it's [Atole agrio][2] or [Firebase][7]. 

While working on a project I act by the words my dad once said to me "*Don't do something a computer could*", meaning not to waste ourselves working in repetitive or boring tasks but instead to create pieces of software to help us and to make our lives easier. Because of that a colleague once said to me "You solve problems no one had seen".
