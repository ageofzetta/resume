## Introduction
  
I'm 27 years old and i'm a web developer. I like to think of myself as a motivated and curious person. I love learning and trying new stuff, whether it is [Atole agrio][2] or [Dandelions][3]. 

While working on a project i act by the words my dad once said to me "*Don't do work the computer can do*", meaning not to waste ourselves working in repetitive or boring tasks but instead to create pieces of software to help us and to make our lifes easier.

I'm always searching for new ways do things better, that's why in my previous job i introduced several improvements: introducing **[Sublime text][5]** [the right way][4], implementing GIT and **[Jekyll][6]** among many other things.
